5 pigeons and 4 pegion holes

|pp| |p| |p| |p| <- this will be how they will be put like

divsubs
<divisible subset>
subset who's sum is divisible by N <size of set> else -1
                            ^
just prove a subarray for this always exist 
<pigeonhole principle>
in lineartime 


1 2 3 5 7 <arr
1 3 6 11 18 < sum till that index     N=5

subarray = (b-a)%N =0
            -> b%N = a%N

1 3 1 1 3< % all values with N <from sum>
0 -> answer there 
1,1 -> subtract 2 same %
<atleast 2 will have same , 5 numbers in 4 baskets>

Gray similar code
N 64 bit int
ai and ai+1 has only one bit change,  find 4 integer if xor is zero
ai ^ai+1 -> 000010 only one 1

if N>=130 always yes 
< we will have 65 pairs and only 1 bit would be set in the xor, indexed to 0-63 loci 
os we have 64 pos and 65 answers, so at least 2 pairs will has same values<bit 1 at sme loci>>

if N<130
brute force method 
find a^b^c^d =0
make 3 loops to find A^b^c and make -> a^b^c=d

2 options - 
> sorting + binary search for d
> hashing 


HOLIDAY 

Total distance= 
n1. e1+n2. e2+...........+nN. eN <weighted sum of eedges>
n1,n2,n3----- -> max number of people through that edge 
<greedy approach> finding multiple local maxima and find total dist>
do DFS in each part for that edge and find minimum units that will go through that edge 

A made a call on B , calls C and that calls d , D cant call , no child  we get N= 4 calls -1 
min(3,N-3) -> other part of tree has N-i 
2*min(i,N-i)*dist for each edge and add
