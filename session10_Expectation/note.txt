Mathematical Expectation

Exp = Avg value of a Random VAriable<outcome of experiment>
E[X}=Summation [x.P(x)] != most probable value, but Average will be close to this result 

Linearity of Expectation 
E[x1+x2]=E[x1]+E[x2]

Bernaulli's Trial 
 exactly 2 outcomes , Head or Tail ,  prime or not prime , yes or no

Theorum 1- expected number of trial's is -> 1/N 
Theorum 2- expected value of successes in n trial -> np

choose number , N students choose 1-100 , prob expected a numebr choosen by n students

np -> 9p/100

Coupon collector 
'N' distinct coupon , packets has coupon , how many packets needed to get all coupons?
e[xi]->no. of paacks to grab ith new coupon
e[x]=e[x1]+e[x2].......+e[xn]

Prob of ith new coupon = avbl coupon / total coupon = n-(i-1)/n 
e[xi]=n/n-i+1
e[x] = ....... add all
